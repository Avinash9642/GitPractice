# Project Files

This project contains the following files:

## index.html

The `index.html` file is the main HTML file for this project. It serves as the entry point for the web application and contains the structure and content of the webpage. It includes various HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

## style.css

The `style.css` file is a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) file that is used to define the visual appearance and layout of the HTML elements in the `index.html` file. It contains CSS rules and properties that specify the colors, fonts, sizes, margins, and other visual aspects of the webpage.

By separating the CSS code into a separate file, it allows for easier maintenance and organization of the styles. The `style.css` file is linked to the `index.html` file using the `<link>` element in the HTML `<head>` section.

Feel free to modify and customize these files to suit your project's needs.
